# Sputtering-and-deposition-of-thin-films-prediction-based-on-deep-learning

## Abstract
As sputter equipment becomes more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the parameters that affect the thickness uniformity of thin metal film deposited by sputter. To address this issue, we verified a deep learning model that can predict complex relationships. Specifically, we trained the model to predict the height of 36 magnets based on the thickness of the material, using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and 2D-Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN) algorithms. After evaluating each model, we found that the MLP model exhibited the best performance, especially when the dataset was constructed regardless of the thin film material. In conclusion, our study suggests that it is possible to predict the sputter equipment source using film thickness data through a deep learning model, which makes it easier to understand the relationship between film thickness and sputter equipment.
